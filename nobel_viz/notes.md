# Data Visualization with Python and JavaScript
This repository is built from Kyran Dale's book _Data Visualization with Python and JavaScript_

The book takes the reader along an entire workflow for a budding data visualizer (myself). The workflow introduced by the author uses the following structure:

1. Getting Your Data (Scrape)
    - Using BeautifulSoup for the lighter weight scraping tasks, then Scrapy for the industrial strength projects
2. Cleaning Your Data (Clean)
    - Using Pandas to manipulate a dirty dataset scraped from the web, into a clean dataset ready for exploration and processing
3. Explore/Process
    - IPython + Pandas + Matplotlib + Seaborn
4. Deliver
    - Flask RESTful API
5. Transform
    - D3 Interactive Visualization
